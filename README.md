# Welcome

This is a Computer Vision application which can distinguish between different types of Durian, the spikey "king of fruits" which is consumed and traded commonly in Southeast Asia.
The model can differentiate between premium grade (more expensive) and lower-grade Durian breeds, and has applications as a first-level filter in larger-scale eCommerce operations that Durian vendors
both in Asia and North America are increasingly dependent on.

The model evaluates image, video, and live video inputs and can determine type of Durian found within the sample input, and estimate its price/kg.
